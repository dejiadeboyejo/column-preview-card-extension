                BEST LUXURY SUVs(2022)
            </h2>
            <p>
                With the passing of another year, the luxury-sedan market recedes further into the darkness. Stepping into the light is an army of sleek SUVs. Out front in the mid-size luxury SUV segment are performance models such as the exotic Lamborghini Urus and brutish Porsche Cayenne. Off-roaders such as the legendary Land Rover Defender and tough-as-nails Lexus GX are also available. Many manufacturers compete in this growing market, so the innovation and technologies included in their offerings are impressive.

                While fundamentally the same as its brother, the X5, BMW's X6 differentiates itself from its squarer sibling by way of its angled rear hatch. For the 2022 model year, the X6 is available in 40i, M50i, and M forms. Each comes standard with all-wheel drive. An attractive and driver-focused interior comes standard, as do 16-way power seats, a touchscreen infotainment system, and Apple CarPlay and Android Auto compatibility. Those looking to accessorize have plenty of options to choose from, including a head-up display, surround sound, and navigation.

                "Grab your Guccis, status slaves: the price of fame is rising fast." While C/D legend Brock Yates was referring to the other Lambo truck, those words ring as true today as they did then. Nobody needs Lamborghini's 641-hp SUV; especially not when the Audi RS Q8 and Cayenne Turbo can be had for nearly half of the Urus's $229,495 asking price. Alas, those searching for a super truck will settle for nothing less. And with a quarter mile time of 11.3 seconds, the Urus is nothing short of super. It goes, turns, and stops exactly like the badge on the back suggests it should, as we found out during Lighting Lap 2019.

                Since its arrival for the 2003 model year, the Porsche Cayenne has offered sports-car athleticism wrapped in a practical package. The company's flagship SUV adds an updated infotainment system that comes standard with wireless Apple CarPlay for 2022. Android Auto is finally available in the 2022 Cayenne, too. The 355-hp base model, with its $70,350 starting price, represents the best value in the lineup. Nonetheless, those looking for more power or efficiency have a diverse palette of powertrain options to choose from, including S, E-Hybrid, and GTS trims.
