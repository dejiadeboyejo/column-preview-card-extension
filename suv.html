                BEST SUVS (2022)
            </h2>
            <p>
                SUVs have evolved. A class that started out as truck-like body-on-frame brutes has morphed into car-like vehicles with unibody construction. Though off-road enthusiasts may snub these car-based SUVs (also known as crossovers), consumers have embraced them in huge numbers thanks to their combination of a commanding seating position and pleasant, car-like driving dynamics. A number of these crossover SUVs are even capable of holding their own off the beaten path, while a few drive like tall sports sedans.

                Whether you're looking to save money on a mainstream brand's SUV or enjoy the grandiose style of a luxury model, our editors have put just about every SUV sold today through our barrage of testing. This has allowed us to whittle down a list of the best SUVs available, all of which currently hold a spot on our coveted 10Best list or nabbed one of our Editors' Choice awards for 2022, as well.

                Looking like a taller, more rugged Mazda 3 hatchback, the 2022 CX-30 snuggles up next to the CX-5 on the small end of the brand's SUV lineup. Its curvaceous exterior design and near-premium cabin give the CX-30 an upscale appearance that almost puts it in contention with subcompact luxury crossovers such as the Audi Q3 and the BMW X1, but its pricing is more aligned with mainstream subcompact SUVs such as the Hyundai Kona and the Volkswagen Taos. The entry-level engine is a 2.5-liter four-cylinder, which delivers tepid acceleration; hot-shoe drivers will find the optional turbocharged 2.5-liter far more desirable. Handling is agile and the CX-30's on-road demeanor is reminiscent of Mazda's sportier offerings, which we greatly appreciate; so much so, that we gave it an Editors' Choice award. A generous helping of infotainment and driver-assistance features is standard and, starting this year, so is all-wheel drive.

                When an SUV delivers as crisp a driving experience as the 2022 Hyundai Kona, it's hard to get hung up on the usual anti-crossover sentiment—so we won't. The subcompact Kona is, simply put, a great package that blends carlike on-road behavior with bold styling, a dose of practicality, and an elevated driving position; we like it so much we gave it an Editors' Choice award. Two four-cylinder engines are offered: a 2.0-liter four, which is admittedly pretty poky, and a more desirable turbocharged 1.6-liter four that delivers a lot more punch. Sticking to Hyundai's value-forward approach, the Kona comes with a long list of standard features which only grows as you move through the more expensive trims—the top few of which get downright posh. The Kona is one of the smaller offerings in the subcompact SUV segment, so it gives up cargo and passenger space to some of its larger rivals, but we think the trade-off for the Hyundai's compact package and fun-to-drive nature more than makes up for those shortcomings.

                Don't get hung up on the 2022 BMW X1's bread-box shape. It's actually a small, playful SUV that just happens to be practical and easy to live with. All models come with the same 228-hp turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine, and it's perky enough to haul the little X1 around town with alacrity. At the same time, it's fairly efficient and delivered 29 mpg highway in our testing. Handling is crisp and the ride is refined, exactly what we expect from the BMW brand. Not only does the X1 deliver on-road enjoyment, but its large cargo area also provides plenty of room for cargo and the rear seats are easy to fold flat to make room for bulkier items. Its well-rounded nature has earned it a place on our 2022 Editors' Choice list. BMW also sells the more stylish X2, which is admittedly even sportier to drive, but we think the X1 offers a better blend of driving fun and practicality.
