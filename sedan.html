            </h2>
            <p>
                Sedans are an enduring part of the automotive universe. Their simple three-box shape is familiar to everyone from toddlers to pensioners. We've compiled a list of the best four-doors, from entry-level economy models to leather-lined luxury cars, all of which earned 10Best or Editors' Choice awards this year. there's something here for everyone—including thrill-seekers who are sure to appreciate the sports sedans on this list as much as we do.

                Just because a car is cheap doesn't mean it needs to look cheap, and the 2022 Hyundai Accent offers dignified styling despite its bargain-basement price tag. We like it enough that we named it to our Editors' Choice list. All models come with a 120-hp four-cylinder engine with a continuously variable automatic transmission (CVT). It's not exciting, but it gets the job done and does so while sipping fuel. The interior, which is also unexciting but functional, offers modern conveniences and even some luxuries. The loaded Limited model costs less than $21,000 and offers heated seats, touchscreen infotainment, and push-button start. No matter which trim you choose, the Accent's appearance is mature and contemporary, saving you from the embarrassment of being outed as a penny pincher.

                The Kia Rio represents cheap, simple transportation at its best. Fuel efficient and inexpensive but with a surprising amount of driving sophistication and features for the price, this subcompact provides good value for the money. It’s available as either a sedan or a hatchback, but neither body style has much space in the rear seat or cargo area. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are standard equipment, and several driver-assistance features are optional. Now that many of its competitors—including the Chevy Sonic, Honda Fit, and Toyota Yaris—have left the marketplace, the Rio is one of the last truly cheap new cars left, and it’s good enough to earn a spot on our 2022 Editors' Choice list.

                Honda's popular Civic compact car gets a big glow-up for the 2022 model year as it debuts a more grown-up appearance, new features, and a refined cabin design. The improvements and more helped it earn a spot on our Editors' Choice list. A selection of four-cylinder engines—including a turbocharged 1.5-liter—are offered; front-wheel drive will continue to be standard as Honda insists all-wheel drive is not part of the plan. Updated tech features such as a larger infotainment display, wireless smartphone connectivity, and improved driver-assistance features are all meaningful updates that will help the Civic stave off competition from the likes of the Hyundai Elantra, the Mazda 3, and the Toyota Corolla.
